It\\u2019s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I\\u2019ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they\\u2019re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They\\u2019re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic.\\nJoe Biden: (18:10)\\nBeing a surgical nurse wasn\\u2019t easy when there wasn\\u2019t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law\\u2019s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you\\u2019ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times.\\nJoe Biden: (18:56)\\nSo many of you had to hold a phone to a patient\\u2019s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn\\u2019t be there. They couldn\\u2019t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family\\u2019s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it\\u2019s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. He said, why is that?\\nJoe Biden: (19:37)\\nAnd I said, because almost everybody who\\u2019s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they\\u2019re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better.\\nJoe Biden: (20:17)\\nThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it\\u2019s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It\\u2019s family like yours and Esther\\u2019s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti.\\nJoe Biden: (20:53)\\nHad been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It\\u2019s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba\\u2019s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I\\u2019m really honored that you\\u2019re going to vote for me in your first election.\\nJoe Biden: (21:33)\\nI promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he\\u2019s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same.\\nJoe Biden: (22:21)\\nWe know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID.\\nJoe Biden: (23:19)\\nAnd this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president\\u2019s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation\\u2019s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7.5 million Americans-\\nJoe Biden: (24:02)\\nAnd nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths.\\nJoe Biden: (24:44)\\nNearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it\\u2019s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide.\\nJoe Biden: (26:09)\\nYou\\u2019re left to figure out how you\\u2019re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you\\u2019re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You\\u2019re asked to risk your neck if you can\\u2019t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you\\u2019re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn\\u2019t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn\\u2019t even realize, and so now they\\u2019ve seen it.\\nJoe Biden: (27:16)\\nI truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis.\\nJoe Biden: (27:40)\\nAn independent analysis, President talks about\\u2026 he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody\\u2019s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here\\u2019s what Moody\\u2019s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president\\u2019s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president\\u2019s plan.\\nJoe Biden: (28:14)\\nAnd here\\u2019s how it works. I\\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won\\u2019t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I\\u2019m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It\\u2019s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class.\\nJoe Biden: (28:50)\\nWhen I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren\\u2019t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We\\u2019re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability.\\nJoe Biden: (29:50)\\nMy plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely.\\nJoe Biden: (30:07)\\nAnd clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We\\u2019ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We\\u2019re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don\\u2019t have to tell you in Miami, don\\u2019t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn\\u2019t work. Look, that\\u2019s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You\\u2019re dealing with it right now. What do you have to do to get knocked in the head to understand it?\\nJoe Biden: (31:18)\\nWe\\u2019re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they\\u2019re the center of a community. Whether it\\u2019s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We\\u2019re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It\\u2019s long past time. I\\u2019ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they\\u2019re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period.\\nJoe Biden: (32:29)\\nAnd for our essential workers, we\\u2019re not just going to praise you, we\\u2019re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We\\u2019re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We\\u2019re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We\\u2019re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We\\u2019re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses.\\nJoe Biden: (33:10)\\nWe\\u2019re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I\\u2019m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible.\\nJoe Biden: (33:33)\\nEvery three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they\\u2019ll go through all 12 years and many beyond.\\nJoe Biden: (34:04)\\nAnd we\\u2019ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income\\u2026 and by the way, the total cost of that\\u2026 it\\u2019s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don\\u2019t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We\\u2019re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.\\nJoe Biden: (35:04)\\nIt\\u2019s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I\\u2019d ever made. And I couldn\\u2019t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it\\u2019s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. That\\u2019s why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiver-\\nJoe Biden: (36:03)\\n\\u2026 Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re going to do. It\\u2019s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you\\u2019ll automatically be able to go, and you\\u2019ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you\\u2019re buying your first home, you\\u2019re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year\\u2026 Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system.\\nJoe Biden: (37:09)\\nWe\\u2019re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We\\u2019re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President\\u2019s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They\\u2019ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It\\u2019s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that.\\nJoe Biden: (38:20)\\nNow imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we\\u2019re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I\\u2019ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he\\u2019s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country.\\nJoe Biden: (39:19)\\nThat\\u2019s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can\\u2019t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I\\u2019ll make sure we\\u2019re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who\\u2019ve fled their country in desperation. I\\u2019ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration\\u2019s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there\\u2019s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana\\u2026 For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles.\\nJoe Biden: (40:40)\\nFirst, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it\\u2019s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration\\u2019s anti-immigration agenda. That\\u2019s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin.\\nJoe Biden: (41:40)\\nFolks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America\\u2019s always done best coming out of crisis. We\\u2019re the only nation it\\u2019s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today\\u2026 If you haven\\u2019t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote.\\nJoe Biden: (42:44)\\nIf you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can\\u2019t let this pandemic change everything. We\\u2019ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I\\u2019m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I\\u2019ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there\\u2019s nothing we can\\u2019t do when we do it together.\\nJoe Biden: (43:34)\\nFolks, I\\u2019ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I\\u2019ve been my whole career. There\\u2019s not a single solitary thing that\\u2019s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world\\u2026 We\\u2019re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I\\u2019d walk out of my grandpa\\u2019s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he\\u2019d yell, \\u201cJoey, keep the faith.\\u201d My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, \\u201cNo, Joey, spread it.\\u201d Let\\u2019s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We\\u2019re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.\\nJoe Biden: (44:34)\\n(music)\",\n          \"Speaker 1: (00:08)\\nFour more years! Four more years!\\nVice President Mike Pence : (00:55)\\nGood evening, America. It\\u2019s an honor to speak to you tonight from the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry, the site of the very battle that inspired the words of our National Anthem. Those words have inspired this land of heroes in every generation since. It was on this site, 206 years ago, when our young Republic heroically withstood a ferocious Naval bombardment from the most powerful empire on earth. They came to crush our revolution, to divide our nation, and to end the American experiment. The heroes who held this Fort took their stand for life, liberty, freedom, and the American flag. And those ideals have defined our nation, but they were hardly ever mentioned at last week\\u2019s Democratic national convention. Instead, Democrats spent four days attacking America. Joe Biden said that we were living through a season of darkness, but as President Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness. In these challenging times, our country needs a President who believes in America, who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people, to meet any challenge, defeat any foe, and defend the freedoms we hold dear. America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Before I go further, allow me to say a word to the families and communities in the path of Hurricane Laura. Our prayers are with you tonight and our administration is working closely with authorities in the states that will be impacted. FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm\\u2019s way. This is a serious storm and we urge all those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities. Stay safe and know that we\\u2019ll be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, respond and recover in the days and weeks ahead. That\\u2019s what Americans do.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (03:47)\\nFour years ago I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. And for the last four years, I\\u2019ve watched this President endure unrelenting attacks, but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. So with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States. Serving the American people in this office has been a journey I never expected. It\\u2019s a journey that would not have been possible without the support of my family, beginning with my wonderful wife, Karen. She\\u2019s a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three children, and she is one outstanding Second Lady of the United States. I\\u2019m so proud of her. And we couldn\\u2019t be more proud of our three children, Marine Corps Captain Michael J. Pence and his wife, Sarah, our daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, an author and the wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond who is currently deployed and serving our in the United States Navy, and our youngest, a recent law school grad, our daughter, Audrey and her fiance who like so many other Americans, had to delay their wedding this summer. But we can\\u2019t wait for Dan to be a part of our family.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (06:25)\\nIn addition, my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most is also with us tonight, my mom, Nancy. She is the daughter of an Irish immigrant, 87 years young, and mom follows politics very closely. And the truth be told, sometimes I think I\\u2019m actually her second favorite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket. Thank you, mom. I love you.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (07:11)\\nOver the past four years, I\\u2019ve had the privilege to work closely with our President. I\\u2019ve seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see president Trump in lots of different ways, but there\\u2019s no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is: a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance, and if you want a President who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, he\\u2019s not your man. Now, we came by very different routes to this partnership. And some people think we\\u2019re a little bit different. But you know, I\\u2019ve learned a few things watching him, watching him deal with all that we\\u2019ve been through over the past four years. He does things in his own way, on his own terms. Not much gets past him. And when he has an opinion, he\\u2019s liable to share it. He certainly kept things interesting. But more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people. In a city known for talkers, President Trump is a doer, and few presidents have brought more independence, energy or determination to that office.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (09:02)\\nFour years ago, we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, ISIS controlled a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values: freedom of religion and the right to life. That\\u2019s when President Donald Trump stepped in. And from day one he kept his word. We rebuilt our military. This President signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan and created the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years, the United States Space Force. And with that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to-\\nVice President Mike Pence : (10:03)\\nWith that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly 10 years. After years of scandal, that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, president Trump kept his word again. We reformed the VA and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes and many join us tonight in this historic fort. Tonight, we have among us four recipients of the Medal of Honor, six recipients of the Purple Heart, a Gold Star Mother of a gallant naval seaman, and wounded warriors from Soldier Strong, a group that serves our injured veterans every day. We are honored by your presence, and we thank you for your service.\\nCrowd: (11:25)\\nUSA. USA.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (11:48)\\nWith heroes, just like these, we defend this nation every day. Under this Commander In Chief, we\\u2019ve taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil. Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of ISIS territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty. I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world\\u2019s most dangerous terrorist. Iran\\u2019s top general will never harm another American, because Qasem Soleimani is gone. My fellow Americans, you deserve to know, Joe Biden criticized President Trump, following those decisions, decisions to rid the world of two terrorist leaders.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (12:49)\\nBut it\\u2019s not surprising, because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden. It\\u2019s no wonder that the Secretary of Defense, under the Obama-Biden administration once said, that Joe Biden has been, and I quote wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. We\\u2019ve stood up to her enemies and we\\u2019ve stood with our allies. Like when President Trump kept his word and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognize Israel in 26 years.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (13:47)\\nCloser to home, we appointed more than 200 conservative judges to our federal courts. We supported the right to life and all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. When it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some. We passed the largest tax cut and reform in American history. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration ever had. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. In our first three years, businesses, large and small, created more than 7 million good- paying jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs all across America.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (14:40)\\nOur country became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans hit the lowest level ever recorded. OP this 100th anniversary of a woman\\u2019s right to vote, I\\u2019m proud to report that under president Donald Trump, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years and more Americans working, than ever before. In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again. Then the coronavirus struck from China. Before the first case of the coronavirus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (15:46)\\nNow, that action saved untold American lives, and I can tell you firsthand, it bought us invaluable time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II. President Trump marshaled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America, in both political parties. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing and produce supplies that were distributed to hospitals around the land. Today, we\\u2019re conducting more than 800,000 tests a day, and we have coordinated the delivery of billions, of pieces of personal protective equipment for our amazing doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (16:46)\\nWe saw to the manufacturer of 100,000 ventilators in a hundred days, and no one who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We built hospitals, surged military medical personnel, and enacted an economic rescue package that saved 50 million American jobs. As we speak, we\\u2019re developing a growing number of treatments, known as therapeutics, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across America. Now, last week, Joe Biden said that no miracle is coming. But what Joe doesn\\u2019t seem to understand, is that America is a nation of miracles, and I\\u2019m proud to report that we\\u2019re on track to have the world\\u2019s first safe, effective coronavirus vaccine, by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice, in this year like no other, and all the hardship, we\\u2019re finding our way forward again. But tonight our hearts are with all the families that have lost loved ones and have family members still struggling with serious illness. In this country, we mourn with those who mourn. We grieve with those who grieve. This night, I know that millions of Americans will pause and pray for God\\u2019s comfort for each of you. Our country doesn\\u2019t get through such a time, unless it\\u2019s people find strength within. The response of doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers, and everyday Americans who put the health and safety of their neighbors first, has been nothing short of heroic.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (19:13)\\nVeronica [Say as 00:09:16] put on her scrubs every day. Day in and day out, went to work in one of New York city\\u2019s busiest hospitals. She stayed on the job, put in the long hours until it was done, and then got back in her neighborhood and helped neighbors and friends struggling. Her brother, William is a New York City firefighter, and they\\u2019re both emblematic of heroes all across this country. They\\u2019re with us tonight. I say to them, and to all of you, you have earned the admiration of the American people, and we will always be grateful for your service and care.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (20:03)\\nAnd we will always be grateful for your service and care.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (20:18)\\nThanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we\\u2019re slowing the spread, we\\u2019re protecting the vulnerable, and we\\u2019re saving lives and we\\u2019re opening up America again. Because of the strong foundation that President Trump poured in our first three years, we\\u2019ve already gained back 9.3 million jobs in the last three months alone. And we\\u2019re not just opening up America again, we\\u2019re opening up America\\u2019s schools and I\\u2019m proud to report that my wife Karen, that schoolteacher I\\u2019ve been married to, will be returning to her classroom next week and so to all of our heroic teachers and faculty and staff, thank you for being there for our kids. We\\u2019re going to stay with you every step of the way.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (21:37)\\nIn the days ahead as we open up America again, I promise you, we\\u2019ll continue to put the health of America first, and as we work to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play and we all have a choice to make. On November 3 you need to ask yourself, who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world? The choice is clear, to bring America all the way back, we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\\nSpeaker 2: (22:37)\\nFour more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\\nVice President Mike Pence : (22:42)\\nMy fellow Americans, we\\u2019re passing through a time of testing, but in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we\\u2019ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (23:23)\\nLast week, Joe Biden didn\\u2019t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country, so let me be clear. The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha, too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day, when they walk out that door, they consider our lives more important than their own. People like Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security\\u2019s federal protective service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California. Dave\\u2019s heroism is emblematic of the heroes that serve in blue every day and we\\u2019re privileged tonight to be joined by his sister Angela. Angela, we say to you, we grieve with your family and America will never forget or fail to honor Officer Dave Patrick Underwood.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (25:28)\\nThe American people know we don\\u2019t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African-American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs, and safety, and from the first days of this administration, we\\u2019ve done both, and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African-American and minority communities across this land for four more years.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (26:18)\\nNow Joe Biden says that America is systemically racist and that law enforcement in America has and I quote \\u201d an implicit bias against minorities.\\u201d When asked whether he\\u2019d support cutting funding to law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, \\u201cYes. Absolutely.\\u201d Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America\\u2019s cities. The hard truth is you won\\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\\u2019s America. Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line and we\\u2019re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (27:28)\\nMy fellow Americans we\\u2019re passing through a time of testing, but soon we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a transition candidate and many were asking transition to what? Last week, Democrats didn\\u2019t talk very much about their agenda, and if I were them I wouldn\\u2019t either. Bernie Sanders did tell his followers that Joe Biden would be the most liberal president in modern times. In fact, he said, \\u201cThat many of the ideas he fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream in the Democratic Party.\\u201d At the root of their agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration. That millions of Americans harbor ill will toward our neighbors instead of loving our neighbors as ourselves. The radical left believes that the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children and in the process deprive our people of freedom, prosperity and security. Their agenda is based on government control. Our agenda is based on freedom.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (29:09)\\nWhere President Trump cut taxes, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. Where this president achieved energy independence for the United States, Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels, end fracking, and impose a regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families. Where we fought for free and fair trade and this president stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender, Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers and he actually criticized President Trump for suspending all travel to China at the outset of this pandemic.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (30:01)\\n\\u2026 at the outset of this pandemic. Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants and President Trump, he secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall. Joe Biden wants to end school choice and President Trump believes that every parent should have the right to choose where their children go to school, regardless of their income or area code. President Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life every day of this administration. Joe Biden, he supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth. When you consider their agenda, it\\u2019s clear. Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (31:12)\\nThe choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher. Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot and the truth is our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. But so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country. In this election it\\u2019s not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. It\\u2019s whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets and the unalienable right to life and Liberty, or whether we will leave them a country that\\u2019s fundamentally transformed into something else.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (32:15)\\nWe stand at a crossroads, America. President Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline, but we\\u2019re not going to let it happen. President Donald Trump believes in America and in the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams and freedom. Every day, President Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. Every day, President Donald Trump has been fighting for you, and now it\\u2019s our turn to fight for him.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (33:16)\\nOn this night in the company of heroes, I\\u2019m deeply grateful. Deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as vice president of this great nation and to have the opportunity to serve again. I pray to be worthy of it and I will give that duty all that\\u2019s in me. In the year 2020, the American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully we have a president with the toughness, energy, and resolve to see us through. Now, those traits actually run in our national character. As the invading force learned on approach to this Fort in September of 1814, against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those who are with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit, but they never did. Fort McHenry held, and when morning came, our flag was still here.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (34:52)\\nMy fellow Americans, we\\u2019re going through a time of testing, but if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see, our flag is still there today. That star spangled banner still waves over the land of the free and the home of the brave. From these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it\\u2019s our turn. So let\\u2019s run the race marked out for us. Let\\u2019s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents. Let\\u2019s fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. Let\\u2019s fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and our freedom, and never forget that where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom. That means freedom always wins.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (36:29)\\nMy fellow Americans, thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight and the opportunity to run and serve again as your vice president. I leave here today inspired and I leave here today, more convinced than ever that we will do in our time as Americans have done throughout our long and storied past, we will defend our freedom and our way of life. We will reelect our president and principled Republican leaders across the land and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God\\u2019s help, we will make America great again, again. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United Sates of America.\",\n          \"George Stephanopoulos: (00:26)\\nWelcome to our town hall with President Trump. Mr. President, thank you for joining us.\\nDonald Trump: (00:30)\\nThank you very much.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (00:31)\\nWe\\u2019re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. As you can see, we\\u2019re socially distanced in this COVID era.\\nDonald Trump: (00:34)\\nI can see, definitely. There\\u2019s no doubt about it.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (00:36)\\nEveryone\\u2019s been tested. You should know that some of these people voted for you last time around, some voted for Hillary Clinton, some voted for third party candidates or no one at all. All have written their own questions. The first one comes from Paul Tubiana. Paul, take it away.\\nDonald Trump: (00:52)\\nHi, Paul.\\nPaul Tubiana: (00:56)\\nMr. President, I voted for you in 2016. I\\u2019m conservative pro-life and diabetic. I\\u2019ve had to dodge people who don\\u2019t care about social distancing and wearing face masks. I thought you were doing a good job with a pandemic response until about May 1st. Then you took your foot off the gas pedal. Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?\\nDonald Trump: (01:22)\\nWell, we really didn\\u2019t, Paul. We\\u2019ve worked very hard on the pandemic. We\\u2019ve worked very hard. It came off from China. They should have never let it happen. If you look at what we\\u2019ve done with ventilators and now, frankly, with vaccines, we\\u2019re very close to having a good vaccine. If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals. And we\\u2019re within weeks of getting it, could be three weeks, four weeks, but we think we have a Johnson & Johnson Pfizer. We have great companies and they\\u2019re very, very close. It\\u2019s a terrible thing. But if you look at as an example, are you from New York? Where are you from?\\nPaul Tubiana: (02:05)\\nOriginally, I\\u2019m from New York. I\\u2019ve lived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for 18 and a half years. It\\u2019s the longest place I\\u2019ve ever lived.\\nDonald Trump: (02:12)\\nWell, that\\u2019s very good. It\\u2019s a good place. But actually, if you look at what we\\u2019ve done for various things, we built hospitals. New York, we took the Convention Center, converted it to 2,800 rooms. We brought in the ships. I wish they would have used it because frankly they would have saved a lot of people had they used it, but we really are. We\\u2019re starting to get very good marks. If you look at what we\\u2019ve done compared to other countries with the excess mortality, the excess mortality rate, we\\u2019ve done very, very well.\\nDonald Trump: (02:40)\\nWhen you see our testing, we\\u2019re going to be at 84 million tests, 84 million. Think of that. And next would be India with about 50 million less. Our testing program\\u2019s far greater. I brought this along today because I think it\\u2019s something that\\u2019s really very special. We have a new test that came out literally today, that\\u2019s just showing you a numbers of how well we\\u2019re doing relative to other countries.\\nDonald Trump: (03:05)\\nBut this is actually a new test just came out from Abbott, highly sophisticated. You wouldn\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a piece of a really little light cardboard. This came out and this is a very accurate test and people will be able to have this and they\\u2019ll be able to test or ideally go through a doctor. But it\\u2019s very simple and very accurate.\\nDonald Trump: (03:27)\\nWe supplied governors including this state with equipment like nobody\\u2019s ever gotten. We were short on ventilators because the cupboards were bare when we took it over. We\\u2019re now making thousands of ventilators a month, many thousands that we\\u2019re sending, and we don\\u2019t need them in our country anymore. Not one person that needed a ventilator, didn\\u2019t get a ventilator. Everybody got a ventilator and, Paul, they\\u2019re very complex. They\\u2019re very hard to make, but we\\u2019re making out tens of thousands a month and sending them to other countries who are in dire need of them.\\nDonald Trump: (03:59)\\nI feel that we\\u2019ve done a tremendous job, actually and it\\u2019s something that I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s been recognized like it should. But when you look at our testing, when you look at our swabs, when you look at our ventilators, when you look at what we\\u2019ve done with hospitals, and we\\u2019ve made a lot of governors look very good and now some are in a shutdown and some aren\\u2019t, we\\u2019d like to see it open up and open up as soon as possible. But we\\u2019re very proud of the job we\\u2019ve done, and we\\u2019ve saved a lot of lives, a tremendous number of lives.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (04:28)\\nMr. President, you mentioned a number of things. Let\\u2019s talk about the mortality first, because you said we\\u2019re doing better in mortality than other countries. But here\\u2019s this chart right here. It shows the United States is right here. This is number of deaths per million residents. Here\\u2019s Western Europe here, Canada way down there. We\\u2019re not at the top of the list.\\nDonald Trump: (04:44)\\nThe excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world. I mean, I can show you there\\u2019s a chart that just came out a little while ago. Excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it\\u2019s about 25% better. In one case, it\\u2019s over 60% better. And we also have a very big country here. This is, we\\u2019re talking about a lot bigger than most countries. When you look at testing, just as an example, when India does 40 million less tests than us, they have 1.5 billion people. China, you don\\u2019t get the accurate numbers out of China, but China, they lost a lot of people. They just don\\u2019t say what-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (05:22)\\nActually, we have 4% of the world\\u2019s population, more than 20% of the cases, more than 20% of the deaths.\\nDonald Trump: (05:28)\\nWell, we have 20% of the cases because of the fact that we do much more testing. If we wouldn\\u2019t do testing, you wouldn\\u2019t have cases. You would have very few cases.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (05:35)\\nAs you know, Dr. Fauci, says most of these are actual cases.\\nDonald Trump: (05:38)\\nWell, Dr. Fauci, said we\\u2019ve done a fantastic job. He just said it yesterday. Actually, he said we\\u2019ve done a fantastic job that we didn\\u2019t mislead anybody. Now. I\\u2019m not going to make people feel like I want to\\u2026 Look, with a leader of a great country, we want to keep it that way. I don\\u2019t want to scare people. I don\\u2019t want to make people panic and you\\u2019re not going to go out and say, \\u201cOh, this is going to be. This is death, death, death.\\u201d You have to run a country. We\\u2019re in a country. We got hit by something very unfairly.\\nDonald Trump: (06:08)\\nWhat I noticed yesterday Dr. Fauci, said that we\\u2019ve done a really good job and we didn\\u2019t mislead anybody. He came out with that statement, which I appreciate. But whether it\\u2019s Dr. Fauci, or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong. They talked about, don\\u2019t wear masks, and now they say wear masks, although some people say don\\u2019t wear masks. I mean, you have a lot of different ideas. Some people say, \\u201cJust leave it the way it is and don\\u2019t do any shutdowns.\\u201d Other people say, \\u201cDo shutdowns.\\u201d I have my own views on that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:37)\\nWhat did you get wrong? You say a lot of people got things wrong. I mean, you mentioned China at the top right there. All through January and February, you were down playing by your own admission, the severity of the crisis that you didn\\u2019t want to panic people.\\nDonald Trump: (06:50)\\nNot down playing-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:50)\\nLet me just finish the question first.\\nDonald Trump: (06:51)\\nNot downplaying.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:53)\\nBut you said, those are your words.\\nDonald Trump: (06:54)\\nI don\\u2019t want to drive our nation into a panic. I\\u2019m a cheerleader for this nation. I\\u2019m the one that closed up our country. I closed it up long before any of the experts thought I should and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But when I closed it, I put a ban on our country. And the ban was a very important ban because China [crosstalk 00:07:12]. China was heavily infected.\\nDonald Trump: (07:15)\\nBy the way, I read where other people said, \\u201cDo it.\\u201d No people that I saw said do it, and I know they said security advisers and others. I put a ban on when it wasn\\u2019t at all popular. Joe Biden said I was xenophobic because I put the ban on, and I thought that was a very unfair. By the way, he\\u2019s totally taken that back. But I\\u2019m not sure he knows what it means, anyway.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (07:36)\\nI want to ask you about China though, because at that time you were actually praising President Xi. You were saying he was transparent. You were saying he was strong. You were saying he was doing a good job. Did you get that wrong? Did you misjudge President Xi?\\nDonald Trump: (07:48)\\nI don\\u2019t think I did. We just finished a trade deal. We just had the largest order of corn in the history of our country last week, the largest order of soybeans, largest order of beef, because they know I\\u2019m very unhappy. They know I\\u2019m very, very-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:00)\\nBut you said he was doing a good job and now you\\u2019re blaming China.\\nDonald Trump: (08:02)\\nNo, I didn\\u2019t say one way or the other. I\\u2019m not saying one way or the other. At the beginning before anybody knew what it was, I spoke with President Xi and he said, \\u201cWe are doing it well. We are having it under control.\\u201d And I was very open with that. He told me that it was under control, that everything was, and it turned out to be not true, because it wasn\\u2019t under control. It went all over the world, 188 countries.\\nDonald Trump: (08:25)\\nI didn\\u2019t say anything bad about President Xi initially, because nobody knew much about the disease. Nobody knew the seniors are susceptible. They thought people would be susceptible, but not\\u2026 The seniors are really a very, very endangered group of people, especially if they have problems with hearts or diabetes or any of that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:43)\\nYou mentioned masks. We had Julie Bard, who\\u2019s from Gibsonia, Pennsylvania. She\\u2019s right here. She has a question about that. You voted for Hillary Clinton last time, I believe.\\nJulie Bard: (08:51)\\nYes, I did. The wearing of mask has proven to lessen the spread of COVID. Why don\\u2019t you support a mandate for national mass wearing, and why don\\u2019t you wear a mask more often?\\nDonald Trump: (09:02)\\nWell, I do wear them when I have to, and when I\\u2019m in hospitals and other locations. But I will say this, they said at the Democrat Convention, they\\u2019re going to do a national mandate. They never did it, because they\\u2019ve checked out and they didn\\u2019t do it. A good question, as you ask, like Joe Biden, they said, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to do a national mandate unrest-\\u201d\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (09:24)\\nHe\\u2019s called on all governors to have them. It is the state responsibility.\\nDonald Trump: (09:26)\\nNo, but he didn\\u2019t do it. I mean, he never did it. By the way, a lot of people don\\u2019t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good. And there are a lot of people that, as an example, you have-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (09:38)\\nWho are those people?\\nDonald Trump: (09:39)\\nI\\u2019ll tell you who those people are, waiters. They come over and they serve you, and they have a mask. I saw it the other day where they were serving me and they\\u2019re playing with a mask. I\\u2019m not blaming them. I\\u2019m just saying what happens. They\\u2019re playing with a mask, and so the mask is over and they\\u2019re touching it. And then they\\u2019re touching the plate. That can\\u2019t be good.\\nDonald Trump: (09:58)\\nThere are a lot of people, if you look at Dr. Fauci\\u2019s original statement, you look at a lot of people, CDC, you look at a lot of people\\u2019s original statement, they said very strongly George, \\u201cDon\\u2019t wear masks.\\u201d Then all of a sudden they want to wear masks. The concept of a mask is good, but it also does, you\\u2019re constantly touching it, you\\u2019re touching your face, you\\u2019re touching plates. There are people that don\\u2019t think masks are good.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (10:22)\\nLet\\u2019s get one final question on COVID. We\\u2019ve got Johnny Powell right here. She\\u2019s from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you actually haven\\u2019t voted before. How are you?\\nJohnny Powell: (10:31)\\nHello. Hi. My question is, if you believe it\\u2019s the president\\u2019s responsibility to protect America, why would you downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low income families and minority communities?\\nDonald Trump: (10:47)\\nYeah. Well, I didn\\u2019t downplay it. I actually, in many ways I applied it in terms of action. [crosstalk 00:10:54]. My action was very strong because what I did was with China, I put a ban on, with Europe, I put a ban on, and we would have lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on. So that was called action. Not with the mouth, but in actual fact, we did a very, very good job when we put that ban on, whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important. So we saved a lot of lives when we did that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (11:18)\\nThere were holes in the ban and the European ban didn\\u2019t come for another month.\\nDonald Trump: (11:22)\\nWell, they were Americans. I mean, the holes in were if you have somebody in China, that\\u2019s an American citizen, we had to let them in. I mean, there were actually some people that said, well, once it got going, they said, \\u201cWait a minute. That is really a heavily infected place.\\u201d We had a case where we had a lot of Americans, they probably had COVID and we\\u2019re saying, \\u201cDo we let them into our country?\\u201d We let them in very carefully. We quarantined them, but we let them in. But yeah, they say that we allowed certain people and it\\u2019s true, but they were American citizens.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (11:54)\\nI want to move on to some other subjects, but we\\u2019re still [inaudible 00:11:56] with 195,000 deaths in the United States right now. When you see that, when you think about that, does that give you any pause? Does it make you think, \\u201cIs there anything I could have done differently?\\u201d Anything-\\nDonald Trump: (12:07)\\nI think we could have had 2 million deaths if we didn\\u2019t close out the country.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (12:11)\\nSo you regret nothing?\\nDonald Trump: (12:12)\\nNo, I think we did a great job. If we didn\\u2019t close the country, look, we created, I created, we all created it together. You helped everybody. The fact is, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, everything, the best employment, high school, no high school, college. We had the best economy we\\u2019ve ever had. 160 million people almost, just short of 160 million people. We were never closed.\\nDonald Trump: (12:42)\\nAnd then somebody comes in and then somebody else, doctors, and they start talking about the pandemic and about closing, they want to close up our country. I said, \\u201cWait a minute. We have the greatest country, the greatest economy.\\u201d And it was coming together, even in terms of unity, because it was so successful that people that weren\\u2019t getting along were starting to get along, George. That\\u2019s the way we solved that problem. But we had the greatest economy ever, and we have to close it. If I didn\\u2019t close it, I think you\\u2019d have 2 million deaths instead of having the 185, 190. It\\u2019s a terrible. [crosstalk 00:13:15].\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:17)\\n\\u2026 more mitigation earlier on, there would have been fewer deaths.\\nDonald Trump: (13:21)\\nGeorge, I was so far ahead of my closing. I\\u2019ll give you an example. When I closed at the end of January, Joe Biden was talking about in March about it\\u2019s totally over-exaggerated. Nancy Pelosi was standing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco, late a month, more than a month after that saying, \\u201cThis thing\\u2019s totally exaggerated, come to try and build up tourism.\\u201d And all of these people-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:50)\\nYou were saying it was going to disappear.\\nDonald Trump: (13:51)\\nWhat?\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:51)\\nYou\\u2019re saying it was going to disappear.\\nDonald Trump: (13:53)\\nIt is going to disappear. It\\u2019s going to disappear. I still say that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:56)\\nBut not if you don\\u2019t take action. Correct?\\nDonald Trump: (13:58)\\nNo, I still say it. It\\u2019s going to disappear, George. We\\u2019re going to get back. We aren\\u2019t going to have studios like this. We have all of this empty space in between. I want to see people and you want to see people. I want to see football games. I\\u2019m pushing very hard for Big Ten. I want to see Big Ten open, lift the football games, let them play sports. But no, it\\u2019s going to disappear, George. And I say this-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (14:16)\\nBut Dr. Fauci, say we have to hunker down. We have to be prepared for a possible second wave. I understand that you don\\u2019t want to panic people. You said you want people to be calm. You\\u2019ve often talked about Winston Churchill, and FDR, and they did reassure people. They were strong. They did keep people calm, but they also were straight. They said, \\u201cThis war is going to be tough. It\\u2019s going to be a real fight. We have to persevere.\\u201d\\nDonald Trump: (14:39)\\nWhen Churchill was on the top of a building, and he said, \\u201cEverything\\u2019s going to be good. Everything\\u2019s going to be. Be calm.\\u201d And you have the Nazis dropping bombs all over London, he was very brave because he was at the top of a building. It was very well known that he was standing on buildings and they were bombing. And he says, \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s going to be safe.\\u201d I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s being necessarily honest, and yet I think it\\u2019s being a great leader.\\nDonald Trump: (15:03)\\nBut he said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be safe. Be calm. Don\\u2019t panic.\\u201d And you had bombers dropping bombs all over London. So I guess you could say, that\\u2019s not so honest, but it\\u2019s still great leadership.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:17)\\nDo you think it\\u2019s okay to be dishonest?\\nDonald Trump: (15:19)\\nI\\u2019m not looking to be dishonest. I don\\u2019t want people to panic, and we are going to be okay. We\\u2019re going to be okay, and it is going away. It\\u2019s probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine. It would go away without the vaccine, George, but it\\u2019s going to go away a lot faster-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:33)\\nIt will go away without the vaccine?\\nDonald Trump: (15:34)\\nSure. Over a period of time. Sure, with time, it goes away.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:37)\\nAnd many deaths.\\nDonald Trump: (15:39)\\nYou\\u2019ll develope like a hard mentality, it\\u2019s going to be hard developed, and that\\u2019s going to happen. That will all happen. But with the vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:50)\\nWe\\u2019ve got to take a quick break.\\nDonald Trump: (15:50)\\nBut I really believe we\\u2019re rounding the corner, and I believe that strongly.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:53)\\nAs you know, Dr, Fauci, disagrees with that.\\nDonald Trump: (15:55)\\nWell, I mean, but a lot of people do agree with me. You look at Scott Atlas, you look at some of the other doctors that are highlighted from Stanford, look at some of the other doctors, they think maybe we could have done that from the beginning. I think we did it exactly right. We closed it up. Now, we\\u2019re opening and we\\u2019re opening up to a super-vee because the numbers are fantastic.\\nDonald Trump: (16:15)\\nThe employment numbers, you look at, we hired 10.4 million jobs in four months. That\\u2019s a record by far. We have every record. Retail sales are through the roof. We have every record. We did the right thing. If we didn\\u2019t close it up, I believe we\\u2019d have two million, two and a half, maybe three million deaths.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (16:35)\\nWe\\u2019re going to have take more about [inaudible 00:16:35] when we come back. But also race, policing, and protests. We\\u2019ll be right back.Welcome back to our town hall with President Trump. The next question comes from Laura Galvis. She\\u2019s from Glen Shaw, Pennsylvania. Registered nurse, who\\u2019s always voted Republican for president. Laura, go ahead.\\nLaura Galvis: (19:40)\\nHello, Mr. President. Martin Luther King Jr, once famously wrote, \\u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\u201d In the light of the ongoing protests surrounding the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the recent shooting of Jacob Blake, do you feel racial injustices are occurring in this nation? And if so, what can be done to address them?\\nDonald Trump: (20:05)\\nWell, I think they were tragic events, and I do feel that we have to also take into consideration that if you look at our police, they do a phenomenal job. You\\u2019ll have people joke, make mistakes, and they happen. It happens where they have to make a fast decision and some bad things happen. And you also have bad apples, but you have 99% great people. I know the police forces very well. I think almost every one of them. If you look, I\\u2019ve been endorsed by so many of them, and these are great people.\\nDonald Trump: (20:37)\\nI will say this, if you\\u2019re going to stop crime, we have to give the respect back to the police that they deserve. They\\u2019ve done a fantastic job in many locations, but then bad things happen. Look at New York, New York was a very safe city. Rudy Giuliani did a fantastic job. The city was safe, and then all of a sudden we have a mayor. He starts cutting the police force and crime is up a hundred percent, 150%. I saw one form of crime up 300%.\\nDonald Trump: (21:05)\\nSo I think it\\u2019s very important, whether you talk Seattle, where they have very good police, but they\\u2019re not allowed to do their job. You have to allow the police to do their job. I agree with you, those events are terrible, but we have to allow the police to do their job. Otherwise, crime is going to soar.\\nDonald Trump: (21:22)\\nNow, the problem is that in Democrat, usually liberal Democrat run cities, we have tremendous problems. The top 10 most unsafe cities are run by Democrats. You go into the top 25 and top 35, almost every one of them is run by Democrats. No cash bail, just weak policies on crime. We have to give the police the respect that they deserve and we have to give them their mojo. We have to let them protect us.\\nDonald Trump: (21:52)\\nHow about that horrible crime that took place two days ago, where this terrible human being walks up to a police car with two people sitting in the car and he starts shooting bullets right through the glass right in their face and just has destroyed? I hear they\\u2019re going to make it, but they\\u2019re going to have a hard time ever being the same-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (22:11)\\nMr. President-\\nDonald Trump: (22:12)\\nIt\\u2019s just a terrible thing.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (22:14)\\nThat was monstrous. There\\u2019s no question about that. But a lot of people look at the-\\nDonald Trump: (22:18)\\nBut that\\u2019s a lack of respect. When somebody can do that, that\\u2019s a lack of respect. There\\u2019s no retribution. The field, there\\u2019s no retribution. This guy walks up to a police car and he starts shooting point blank range at two innocent people. You can\\u2019t let that happen. You have to be very tough on crime when it comes to that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (22:37)\\nTough on crime, but also obey the rules and regulations for policing. You talk about police choking, you talk about bad apples, but a lot of people look at the statistics, Black Americans, more than three times more likely than White Americans to be killed by police. That indicates that this just isn\\u2019t bad apples. This just isn\\u2019t choking. This is a real systemic endemic problem. Do you believe that? What will you do to address it?\\nDonald Trump: (23:02)\\nSo, just do a poll where\\u2026\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:03)\\nDo you believe that? What will you do to address it?\\nDonald Trump: (23:03)\\nI just saw a poll where African-Americans in this country, black communities are 81% in favor of having more police. They want more police. They want protection. They suffer more than anybody else by bad police protection. All minorities, whether it\\u2019s Hispanic or black or Asian, they suffer more than anybody else, George. We have to give the police back the authority to stop crime. When you have something like in Portland, where it\\u2019s just night after night, I could stop that with the people we have in a half an hour if they\\u2019d let me do that, but they don\\u2019t-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:39)\\nWhat would you do?\\nDonald Trump: (23:41)\\nBring in the National Guard. We\\u2019d bring it in, and we would stop that within\\u2026 Well, we did it in Minneapolis. Take a look at Minneapolis-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:47)\\nHow do you stop police killing blacks at three times the rate of killing whites?\\nDonald Trump: (23:52)\\nI can only say this, that the police in this country have done generally a great job. There are crimes, there are problems, and there are chokers. They choke under pressure. They have one quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes they make a wrong decision. That\\u2019s a terrible thing. The problem is that\\u2019ll be on the news for two weeks or three weeks in a row, and the hundreds of thousands and thousands of good acts, nobody talks about it.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (24:19)\\nYou didn\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a sign of systemic racism?\\nDonald Trump: (24:21)\\nNo, I think there\\u2019s problems, but I also think there\\u2019s some very big problems where if you don\\u2019t give the police back their authority\\u2026 Right now, police are afraid they\\u2019re going to lose their pension, they\\u2019re going to lose their job if they talk to somebody in the wrong way. When I watch New York\\u2026 The New York City Police endorse me, and I love them. [crosstalk 00:24:42] but I watched six months ago, policemen walking down the street, and people were dumping water on their head. They had absolutely no fear. They had absolutely\\u2026 There was no retribution. I thought it was a low point. I thought it was a low point for New York City\\u2019s finest.\\nDonald Trump: (24:59)\\nFrankly, those people should\\u2019ve turned\\u2026 Those cops should\\u2019ve turned around and really done something.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (25:04)\\nWe have another question on the subject from Pastor Carl Day. He\\u2019s from Philadelphia, voted for Jill Stein last time.\\nPastor Carl Day: (25:10)\\nHow you doing, Mr. President?\\nDonald Trump: (25:12)\\nGood.\\nPastor Carl Day: (25:12)\\nYou\\u2019ve coined the phrase, \\u201cMake America great again.\\u201d When has America been great for African-Americans in the ghetto of America? Are you aware of how tone deaf that comes off to the African-American community?\\nDonald Trump: (25:25)\\nWell, I can say this. We have tremendous African-American support. You\\u2019ve probably seen it in the polls. We\\u2019re doing extremely well with African-American, Hispanic-American at levels that you\\u2019ve rarely seen a republican have. If you talk about make America great, if you look at just prior to, and I\\u2019m talking about for the black community, you look just prior to this horrible situation coming in from China, when the virus came in, that was probably the highest point. Home ownership for the black community, home ownership, lower crime, the best jobs they\\u2019ve ever had, highest income, the best employment numbers they\\u2019ve ever had. If you go back and you want to look over many years, you could just go back six or seven months from now, that was the best single moment in the history of the African-American people in this country, I think, I would say.\\nPastor Carl Day: (26:21)\\nWell, I mean, your statement is, \\u201cMake it great again.\\u201d Historically, the African-American experience, especially in these ghettos that have been redlined historically, these ghettos that have systemically been treated the way that they have been, the conditions of the drugs, the guns, and everything else that actually created the symptoms for what we see that you profess to be just the democratic cities themselves, these things have been historically been happening for African-Americans in these ghettos, and we have not been seeing a change. Quite frankly, under your administration, under Obama\\u2019s administration, under the Bush, under the Clinton, the very same things happen, and the very same systems and cycles continue to ensue, and we need to see, because you say again, we need to see when was that great, because that pushes us back to a time in which we cannot identify with such greatness.\\nPastor Carl Day: (27:15)\\nI mean, you\\u2019ve said everything else about choking and everything else, but you have yet to address and acknowledge that there\\u2019s been a race problem in America.\\nDonald Trump: (27:22)\\nIf you go\\u2026 Well, I hope there\\u2019s not a race problem. I can tell you, there\\u2019s none with me, because I have great respect for all races, for everybody. This country is great because of it, but when you go back six months and you take a look at what was happening, you can\\u2019t even compare that with past administrations. When you look at income levels, and a lot of things, because of the job situation, where they had the lowest income, the best unemployment numbers they\\u2019ve ever had, the black community, by far, and that was solving a lot of problems. You know what else? It was bringing people together. I was starting to get, just before\\u2026 We were having a long run of success. I was starting to get calls from democrats that, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s starting to work. Let\\u2019s get together.\\u201d People that you would never have thought this would\\u2019ve happened with, there was going to be unity, but unfortunately, that was hurt because we got set back.\\nDonald Trump: (28:14)\\nNow, I think next year\\u2019s going to be one of our best years economically, but [crosstalk 00:28:18]\\nPastor Carl Day: (28:18)\\nIncome equality is higher. I mean, jobs can be produced, but at the same time, in a lot of these big major cities where African-Americans are underserved, under-resourced, that\\u2019s an $8 an hour job, does not meant that they can necessarily afford to live where they have to live or where they\\u2019ve been living at for the last 20 years.\\nDonald Trump: (28:36)\\nWell, the income inequality, which I agree with you is a problem, I always agreed with that, but if you looked under President Obama and Biden, the income inequality was phenomenal. It was record setting. It was-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (28:49)\\nIt\\u2019s getting worse now.\\nDonald Trump: (28:51)\\nWell, we\\u2019re talking about a plague coming in. Before the plague, we were doing very well. Now, we will soon be doing well again, because we\\u2019re going to have a fantastic third quarter. You\\u2019re seeing the numbers come in. I think you\\u2019re going to have a GDP that\\u2019s mid 20s and may be much higher. Somebody said 35. I don\\u2019t know. These are all records we\\u2019re talking about. You\\u2019re going to have a very good\\u2026 Economically, you\\u2019re going to have a very good year next year, but I agree with a lot of the things you say, but you have to look back, because we really had it going well. Had we not been hit by this horrible disease that came into our land and all over the world, by the way, came all over the world, we would be in a position where I think income inequality would be different. It was really getting there. We were really driving it down.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (29:36)\\nMr. President, we have to move on, but even before the pandemic, the average black family was earning half of what the average white family was earning. Even if you hold education constant-\\nDonald Trump: (29:45)\\nI can only compare it to the past. The African-American, the black community was doing better than it had ever done by far, both in terms of unemployment, home ownership, so many different statistics, even in terms of crime-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (30:02)\\nThere\\u2019s still a gap between blacks and whites.\\nDonald Trump: (30:04)\\nI mean, there was a gap, but we were doing a good job. It was getting better. Then, it was artificially shut down by this disease that came onto our land.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (30:13)\\nGot to take another break. We\\u2019ll be right back.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (34:28)\\nWelcome back to our town hall. We\\u2019re taking questions from voters in Pennsylvania who\\u2019ve not yet made up their minds for a final decision in this election. The next question comes from Leah Schwotzer of Pittsburgh.\\nLeah Schwotzer: (34:38)\\nHello.\\nDonald Trump: (34:39)\\nHi.\\nLeah Schwotzer: (34:40)\\nI worry about a second or third wave of unemployment. Employers that weathered the first six months of COVID-19 are now seeing their businesses dramatically impacted due to the effect of this virus on our economy. What, as a president, is your plan to aid these workers who may not lose their jobs today, but in the months to come?\\nDonald Trump: (35:01)\\nWell, as you know, we did pay check, but we\\u2019re doing a lot of other things. But, what I want to do is see some additional stimulus. We\\u2019re trying to get it, and we may. I mean, just before I came here, we had some pretty good talks with the democrats. We\\u2019ll see, but they\\u2019ve been very difficult-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:14)\\nWhy not call the Speaker down to your office, hammer it out [crosstalk 00:35:17]\\nDonald Trump: (35:17)\\nBecause, they know exactly where I stand. At the right time, I\\u2019ll do that, but they know exactly where I stand. What they want is a bail out of democrat run states that are doing poorly. I don\\u2019t think this is the right way-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:28)\\nWhy do you keep talking about democrat states?\\nDonald Trump: (35:30)\\nThey are.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:30)\\nThey\\u2019re American states and American cities.\\nDonald Trump: (35:32)\\nNo, the democrat run states are the ones that are doing badly, George. If you look at New York, if you look at Illinois, if you look at a lot of different places, they\\u2019re doing poorly, and cities in particular. Cities, I mean, these cities are being run so poorly-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:44)\\nDon\\u2019t you have a responsibility for those states and cities as well?\\nDonald Trump: (35:47)\\n\\u2026 but largely because of the crime. They don\\u2019t want to do anything about crime. Sanctuary cities. They have sanctuary cities where they\\u2019re protecting criminals. They have things that the republicans don\\u2019t have. So, they are. I don\\u2019t want to say\\u2026 Look, I\\u2019m the president of everybody, but I don\\u2019t want to say it, but they\\u2019re democrat run cities. It is what it is.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (36:07)\\nWill you be calling the Speaker in? Can you hammer out a deal?\\nDonald Trump: (36:09)\\nAt the right time, yes, I would like to see additional stimulus for people that really, it wasn\\u2019t their fault. It wasn\\u2019t your fault, wasn\\u2019t anybody\\u2019s fault. It was China\\u2019s fault. I don\\u2019t care how you want to define it. This was China\\u2019s fault, and our people shouldn\\u2019t be hurt. We should do stimulus. We did a lot of it initially, and now they stopped, because they think it\\u2019s going to be better for the election.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (36:33)\\nThey say if you\\u2019ll come up, they said they\\u2019ll meet you halfway on the money.\\nDonald Trump: (36:37)\\nWell, we can do something maybe, but I\\u2019m just hearing for the first time about an hour ago that maybe there is a chance to get something, and I\\u2019d like to do it. I would like to see it happen, George.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (36:46)\\nNext question\\u2019s on healthcare. It comes from Ellesia Blaque. She\\u2019s from Philadelphia, an assistant professor who voted for Hillary Clinton last time.\\nEllesia Blaque: (36:54)\\nHi.\\nDonald Trump: (36:55)\\nHi.\\nEllesia Blaque: (36:56)\\nMr. President, I was born with a disease called sarcoidosis. From the day I was born, I was considered uninsurable. That disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when I went to graduate school, into my brain. When it hit my brain, I was automatically eligible for disability for the rest of my life. I chose instead to get a bachelor\\u2019s degree, a master\\u2019s degree, a PhD, and become a professor.\\nDonald Trump: (37:27)\\nThat\\u2019s great.\\nEllesia Blaque: (37:27)\\nIt is great, except I still have similar healthcare problems. It costs me, with copays, I\\u2019m still paying almost $7,000 a year in addition to the copay, and should preexisting conditions, which Obamacare brought to fruition be removed-\\nDonald Trump: (37:47)\\nNo.\\nEllesia Blaque: (37:48)\\nPlease stop and let me finish my question, sir. Should that be removed? Within a 36 to 72 hour period without my medication, I will be dead. I want to know what it is that you\\u2019re going to do to ensure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we\\u2019re supposed to do, can stay insured. It\\u2019s not my fault that I was born with this disease. It\\u2019s not my fault that I\\u2019m a black woman, and in the medical community, I\\u2019m minimized and not taken seriously. I want to know what you are going to do about that.\\nDonald Trump: (38:22)\\nFirst of all, I hope you are taken seriously. I hope you are. We are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions. We\\u2019re not going to hurt preexisting conditions, and in fact, just the opposite. If you look at what they want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of preexisting conditions. If they go into Medicare for all, which is socialized medicine, and you can forget about your doctors and your plans, just like you can forget under President Obama. He said you can have your doctor, you can have your plan, and that turned out to be a lie. He said it 28 different times, at least. We have 28 different times. You can have your doctor, you can have your plan. Well, it\\u2019s not true. But, what we\\u2019re doing is we\\u2019re going to be doing a healthcare plan, preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions. As an example, yourself. It sounds like that\\u2019s exactly perfect. That\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019re talking about. We\\u2019re going to be doing a healthcare plan very strongly, and protect people with preexisting conditions.\\nDonald Trump: (39:21)\\nI will say this, they will not do that, because they have socialized-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (39:25)\\nI have to stop you there. I just have to stop you there, because just on a couple points. Number one, Joe Biden has ran against Medicare for all in the primaries, but much more importantly, Obamacare guaranteed people with preexisting conditions could buy insurance, guaranteed they could buy it at the same price as everyone else, guaranteed a package of essential benefits, guaranteed that insurance companies couldn\\u2019t put a lifetime limit on those benefits. You fought to repeal Obamacare. You are arguing in the Supreme Court right now to strike it down. That would do away with preexisting conditions.\\nDonald Trump: (39:59)\\nNo, so we can do new healthcare.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:01)\\nYou\\u2019ve been promising a new healthcare plan. I interviewed you in June of last year. You said the healthcare plan would come in two weeks. You told Chris Wallace this summer, it would come in three weeks. You promised an executive order on preexisting-\\nDonald Trump: (40:12)\\nI have it already. I have it already.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:13)\\nBut, you\\u2019ve been trying to strike down preexisting conditions.\\nDonald Trump: (40:16)\\nIt doesn\\u2019t matter. I have it already, and it\\u2019s a much better plan for you, and it\\u2019s a much better plan.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:20)\\nWhat is it?\\nDonald Trump: (40:21)\\nWhen you say Obamacare, I got rid of the individual mandate, which is the worst part of Obamacare.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:25)\\nYou\\u2019re striking down the whole law.\\nDonald Trump: (40:27)\\nWouldn\\u2019t pertain to you, but it\\u2019d pertain to a lot of people where they were going literally bust because they didn\\u2019t want to have health insurance, and they were paying for it anyway, and it was no good. Obamacare was a disaster. Obamacare is too expensive. The premiums are too high. It\\u2019s a total disaster. You\\u2019re going to have new healthcare, and the preexisting condition aspect of it will always be in my plan, and I\\u2019ve said that loud and clear-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:51)\\nBut, you haven\\u2019t come up with it.\\nDonald Trump: (40:52)\\nAnd, we got rid of the individual mandate, which essentially ended Obamacare-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:58)\\nOnly because you\\u2019re arguing for it.\\nDonald Trump: (40:59)\\nGeorge, I had a decision to make. Do I run\\u2026 We gutted out the worst parts of Obamacare. Now, I have to make this decision. This is three years ago. Do we run Obamacare well and do a good job, and do the best, even though it\\u2019s never going to be very good, or do we let it run badly? Probably letting it run badly would\\u2019ve been a better political decision, but I couldn\\u2019t do that. We have run it so much better than Obama ran it. Now, it\\u2019s not the same because I got rid of the most unpopular thing and a very unfair thing, which was the individual mandate.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (41:32)\\nYou\\u2019re trying to strike down the whole law.\\nDonald Trump: (41:34)\\nGeorge, we have run it really well, but we also have now other\\u2026 If you go to Department of Labor, our great secretary as you know, and you know him well, we have other alternatives to Obamacare that are 50% less expensive, and they\\u2019re actually better.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (41:50)\\nIt\\u2019s been three and a half years.\\nDonald Trump: (41:51)\\nGeorge, it\\u2019s been 40 years since you had good healthcare. You never really had good healthcare in this country. This country has never had it. But, when you say that Biden doesn\\u2019t want to do it, everybody else does. Bernie does. He agreed to the manifesto as I call it. The agreement with Bernie is that you\\u2019re going to go to socialized medicine.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (42:12)\\nHe ran against Medicare for all.\\nDonald Trump: (42:14)\\nIf you go to socialized medicine\\u2026 Well, he agreed. Harris, who he today, said, Harris-Biden, because you think she\\u2019s president, Harris\\u2026 Someday, you\\u2019ll have to explain that one to me, but Harris is all for doing that. She wants to go to socialized medicine. You no longer have your doctor really, and you no longer have your plan. And, Joe can say all he wants, he\\u2019s only doing it because he sees his poll numbers going down so substantially. But, Joe can say all he wants about healthcare. Obamacare has been a failure from day one. It\\u2019s too expensive, whether it\\u2019s the premium or whether it\\u2019s the cost generally, and they don\\u2019t have their doctors, and they don\\u2019t have their plans. We\\u2019re going to have a very good healthcare. I think maybe a great healthcare for less money.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (42:58)\\nGot to take another break. We\\u2019ll be right back.\\nCommercial: (48:14)\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:22)\\nWelcome back to our Town Hall with President Trump. Mr President thank you for being here.\\nDonald Trump: (48:26)\\nThank you.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:26)\\nThe next question comes from Jim Roudeski, he\\u2019s from Irwin, Pennsylvania, that\\u2019s around Pittsburgh. And you voted for President Trump last time around.\\nDonald Trump: (48:32)\\nHi Jim.\\nJim Roudeski: (48:33)\\nHi. At times, some have called your behavior not presidential. What, if anything, would you do differently if reelected to create a more unified message where all sides can take responsibilities for their actions and come together to make positive change?\\nDonald Trump: (48:48)\\nGood Jim. So I\\u2019m fighting a battle, it\\u2019s a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me. I have the media, which I call the fake news, because a lot of it is fake. And I mean a big pop, as you understand, a lot of is fake. I\\u2019m fighting a lot of forces. Sometimes you don\\u2019t have time to be totally, as you would say, presidential. You have to get things done. I think I\\u2019ve done more than any other president in the first three and a half years. When you look at what we\\u2019ve done for tax cuts and regulation cuts and the vets, all of the things that we\\u2019ve done for the West, we have a 91% approval factor now for the vets, we rebuilt our military, we created Space Force. I mean, we did so many things, Right-to-try, which is so incredible and so successful. You know what Right-to-try is?\\nDonald Trump: (49:35)\\nWe did more, I really believe it, more than any other president in the first three and a half years. By the way, at the end of my first term, we\\u2019re going to have close to 300, maybe over 300 new federal judges, including Court of Appeal, two Supreme Court justices. And honestly, we move very fast and I have to get rid of people fast because they\\u2019re not doing their job. I could tell you people that weren\\u2019t doing their job. And when I do that to get somebody else that is good, and if they don\\u2019t do it, we get rid of that person.\\nDonald Trump: (50:06)\\nWe do a lot of things and we have to get them done. I could be so pres\\u2026 I always used to sort of kid on the campaign trail that I could be more presidential, would be very easy, more presidential than any other candidate, except for possibly Abraham Lincoln when he\\u2019s wearing the hat, right? The high hat. But the fact is, being presidential is easier than what I have to do, but I get things done. I get things done like nobody\\u2019s ever gotten, including environmental things. When you look at what\\u2019s going on in the country and all that we\\u2019ve done, we unfortunately got hit by this plague, but it\\u2019s going to be back very soon, we opened it up and we have\\u2026you talk Jim about the V. We have a super V, looks like it\\u2019s going to be a super V.\\nDonald Trump: (50:47)\\nWe\\u2019re going to have a great economy next year. And I think we\\u2019re going to have a great economy in the third quarter. And thank you for voting for me in 2016. I hope you\\u2019re going to do it again.\\nJim Roudeski: (50:56)\\nThanks sir.\\nDonald Trump: (50:57)\\nThank you. Thank you very much.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (50:58)\\nYou talk about a super V Mr. President. A lot of people look at this and say, it\\u2019s more like a K-shaped recovery, that people at the top who have a lot of stocks are doing pretty well. [crosstalk 00:51:06]\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (51:08)\\nBut now you\\u2019ve only gotten half the jobs back.\\nDonald Trump: (51:11)\\nGeorge, stocks are owned by everybody. I mean, they talk about the stock market is so good, that\\u2019s 401(k)s. I\\u2019m meeting people with as long as they didn\\u2019t sell when the market went down, when we first realized the extent of this horrible thing from China. I mean, these people are doing, some of them are doing better than they were doing before the pandemic came.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (51:29)\\nSo that 33.6 [inaudible 00:00:51:30].\\nDonald Trump: (51:31)\\nIf people held onto their stocks, and remember this, because I noticed you said wealthy, sure, wealthy, but you have people that aren\\u2019t wealthy, but have done well because of the stock market. I\\u2019ve set records on the stock market even during the pandemic. And that doesn\\u2019t happen by accident. I will tell you this, if Joe Biden ever got this position and that\\u2019s a headwind on the stock market, our stock market would be much higher if it weren\\u2019t for that. If Joe Biden ever got in, I think you\\u2019d have a depression, the likes of which we\\u2019ve never seen in this country. If you look at his policies, where he wants to raise everybody\\u2019s taxes, you look at what he wants to do in terms of regulation, where he wants to put all of the regulations back on that I took off, and then some, and in many cases, double it up, you will have a depression, the likes of which we haven\\u2019t seen in this country, and that doesn\\u2019t affect big people.\\nDonald Trump: (52:22)\\nIt affects everybody. It affects a person that owns $10,000 worth of stock in IBM or whatever company it may be. Look, we\\u2019re having a tremendous thing in the stock market and that\\u2019s good for everybody, but people that aren\\u2019t rich own stock and they have 401(k)s. You take a look at the 401(k)s. They\\u2019re in many cases better than they were before the pandemic came.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (52:46)\\nNext question comes from Alexandra Stehman from Pittsburgh, sat out the last presidential election, I believe.\\nAlexandra: (52:51)\\nUnfortunately so, I did.\\nDonald Trump: (52:53)\\nThank you.\\nAlexandra: (52:54)\\nGood evening Mr. President. So I\\u2019d like to ask regarding your recent comments about our United States soldiers and referring to them as suckers.\\nDonald Trump: (53:04)\\nCould you say that again?\\nAlexandra: (53:07)\\nOur United States soldiers referring to them as suckers and particularly the late John McCain, our prisoners as war losers.\\nDonald Trump: (53:17)\\nOh, oh, I see. Okay. It was a fake statement. Go ahead\\nAlexandra: (53:18)\\nAnd recently requesting to ban amputee veterans from a military parade. How do you expect to win back the support of our military, their families, their friends, and military supporters?\\nDonald Trump: (53:32)\\nIt\\u2019s easy, because they never made those statements. They were never made by me. They said, I stood over the grave of soldiers killed many years ago, and I said they were suckers. I never made that. We had 26 people as of today, come out to say it never happened, and many people were there. Then they said about the rain didn\\u2019t happen and that wasn\\u2019t the reason. The secret service said, we have a statement from them. They said that we could not travel because the helicopter couldn\\u2019t be used, we would not be able to travel. Because when you do that through a major city, it takes them days to get it prepared. I wanted to go anyway. I said, \\u201cLet me just go separately in a car in disguise. I don\\u2019t care.\\u201d I wanted to be there so badly, but the statements never happened. They were lies.\\nDonald Trump: (54:15)\\nAs far as John McCain, I was never a fan of John McCain. I never thought he treated our vets well, he didn\\u2019t do the job. I was never a fan of his, and I think that\\u2019s fine and everybody knows that, and I said it to his face. I was very much up in that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (54:30)\\nYou said he\\u2019s not a war hero.\\nDonald Trump: (54:31)\\nBut as far as [inaudible 00:54:30], I have done so much for our vets and for our military, I rebuilt our military. When I came into this great office, our military was depleted, it was in the worst shape it was in probably ever. It was depleted. The planes were old and broken, the ships, everything. You see what I\\u2019ve done. I\\u2019ve rebuilt $2.5 trillion, and you think that was easy, getting that money from Democrats? Because they don\\u2019t like the military. This magazine came up, they made up this quote. It was a made up quote. And the gloves are off with Biden who I\\u2019ve never respected greatly. I\\u2019ve never respected him greatly. But when they took this made up quote that was now knocked out by over 25 people and they made an ad out of it, I thought it was a disgrace. Do you know what disinformation is? That\\u2019s what it was.\\nDonald Trump: (55:22)\\nThey made up a phony quote and then they went with it. It was a phony deal. And the one who started it was a big friend of President Obama and Clinton. And it was a phony deal from a very not very successful [inaudible 00:55:34].\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (55:35)\\nMr. President you have used language like that in the past. You did say that John McCain wasn\\u2019t a war hero. And notably silent in the wake of this article were General John Kelly, who was your chief of staff at the time. General James Mattis, who served as defense secretary for you has said-\\nDonald Trump: (55:51)\\nThey didn\\u2019t hear me say that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (55:52)\\nHas said, well, I\\u2019m getting to a broader point with the generals.\\nDonald Trump: (55:56)\\nBecause I never said it.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (55:57)\\nGeneral Mattis said, you\\u2019re dividing, you\\u2019re not trying to unite the country. General Kelly said he agreed with that. John Bolton, who was your National Security Advisor said you are a danger to the country. The people in these top military positions who served most closely with you have said you\\u2019re unfit for office. How do you respond to that?\\nDonald Trump: (56:14)\\nThese are people that I let go. These are disgruntled former employees to put it in a nice way with a term people would understand. Mattis was a highly overrated general, didn\\u2019t do the job, didn\\u2019t do good on ISIS. I took over a hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. I had the people that I wanted and Mattis was fired as you know by President Obama. And I fired him also.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (56:35)\\nHe says he resigned.\\nDonald Trump: (56:36)\\nHe didn\\u2019t resign. I said, \\u201cGive me a letter.\\u201d No more. Give me a letter. I was being nice. One of the problems when you\\u2019re nice, oftentimes it comes back to hit you. I said, \\u201cJim, give me a letter. It\\u2019s time for you to move on.\\u201d He gave me a letter, but I fired him, [inaudible 00:56:50], I fired him. Now, General Mattis Didn\\u2019t do the job. I wasn\\u2019t happy with him. If you look at John Bolton, John Bolton, all he wanted to do is blow people up. He wanted to go to war with everybody. And frankly, I used him very nicely. I bring him into a room in a negotiation, when people saw them, they said, \\u201cOh wow, he\\u2019s going to go to war.\\u201d I\\u2019m bringing our troops back from Afghanistan. I\\u2019m bringing our troops back from Iraq. We\\u2019re almost out of almost every place. Everybody said because of my personality, they said, \\u201cHe\\u2019ll be in a war immediately.\\u201d Look at North Korea, how that\\u2019s worked out. The sanctions are on, everything\\u2019s the same, we haven\\u2019t spent anything. We\\u2019re getting along with him, I get along with Kim Jong-un.\\nDonald Trump: (57:36)\\nThat was supposed to be a war. If President Obama were president, if Hillary Clinton ever got in, that would be a war. We would have a war, probably a nuclear war with North Korea. In the meantime, I\\u2019m getting calls all the time from friends of mine in South Korea. \\u201cThank you. We love you. Thank you.\\u201d It\\u2019s really been rather amazing. So instead of wars, everybody said, look at what we had today with the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and just take a look at what happened with Israel today with that. Take a look at what\\u2019s going on. That was going to be a problem. We\\u2019re actually creating peace in the Middle East without blood staining our sand. Look at what happened with Bahrain-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (58:18)\\nYou\\u2019ve criticized Jim Mattis.\\nDonald Trump: (58:19)\\nGeorge, look at what happened with Bahrain. Well, a guy like Jim Mattis would have disagreed with the way I went about it, and I\\u2019ve turned out to be correct. Tom Friedman of the New York Times wrote incredible glowing articles last week about this incredible thing that I\\u2019ve been able to do in the Middle East. A guy like Jim Mattis could have never done it because they were all doing it the old fashioned way. They were going in the wrong outlets and the wrong doors. And what happened today with the UAE, and with Bahrain, and with Israel, people don\\u2019t even believe it. And George, as sure as you\\u2019re sitting there, I have numerous other countries in that region that are going to be signing very soon also. You\\u2019ll have peace in the Middle East, and this is without war and without losing, and I\\u2019m talking about on both sides, but without losing our great young soldiers.\\nDonald Trump: (59:09)\\nI go to Dover and I greet oftentimes soldiers coming in, and they\\u2019re dead. And there\\u2019s no sadder thing than to sit with a widow or a mother and watch these big, massive cargo planes, and that back opens up and these incredible Marines are walking off a casket and they were killed in the Middle East. And in many ways, nobody even knows why. Going there was the worst decision in the history of our country. We\\u2019ve spent $8 trillion and we\\u2019ve lost thousands of lives, but really millions of lives because I view both sides. Okay? If that\\u2019s okay. Millions of lives, this was the worst decision. And by the way, Iraq did not\\u2026 Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center in case you don\\u2019t know, and I\\u2019m sure you do know that. They said they had weapons of mass destruction, they made a mistake. So we\\u2019re now $8 trillion. We\\u2019ve been in there for 20 years, almost 20 years in Afghanistan. I guess it\\u2019s getting very close to that, it\\u2019s over 19 and we\\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:18)\\nNobody expected that from me and people are so happy about it. And you know who\\u2019s the happiest? The soldiers. I see them all the time. \\u201cWhat do you think? Should we be here?\\u201d \\u201cNo, sir. You shouldn\\u2019t be here.\\u201d \\u201cWhy?\\u201d \\u201cThey don\\u2019t like us, sir.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll tell you what, I\\u2019ve rarely met a soldier that\\u2019s over there. They\\u2019re better than anybody because they can tell you better than anybody what\\u2019s happening. Rarely do I meet a soldier that says we should be there. It was the worst mistake, the most costly mistake in the history of our country, going into the Middle East.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:00:45)\\nGoing to be right back.\\nCommercial: (01:00:53)\\nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 2020, The President and The People will return in a moment. The President and The People, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:06:03)\\nWelcome back to our Town meeting with President Trump. The next question comes from Alexander J. Floyd of Dallas, Pennsylvania. He voted for President Trump last time around.\\nAlexander: (01:06:12)\\nHello Mr. Trump. My question is actually about police reform. And how can we balance common sense police reform without sacrificing public safety in a time when part of the country is calling to defund the police and actively cheering when they\\u2019re gunned down in the street, and another part is tired of seeing the lawlessness?\\nDonald Trump: (01:06:30)\\nSo we have a great Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina, and he had a plan that was very much of a compromise plan, but it was a plan that everybody pretty much agreed to. A lot of Democrats agreed to it, but they wouldn\\u2019t vote for it. And it was a really good, it was a compromise of a lot of different factors, and it didn\\u2019t get done, and it should have gotten done and it could still be out there, it could still be resurrected very easily, but they just didn\\u2019t want to do it. Because I think the Democrats are viewing this as a political issue, and I probably agree with them. I think it\\u2019s very bad for them because we\\u2019re about law and order, we have to be about law and order. Otherwise you\\u2019re going to see your cities burn and that\\u2019s the way it is.\\nDonald Trump: (01:07:10)\\nIf we can do a plan like Tim Scott\\u2019s plan, which is really, it goes far enough, but it doesn\\u2019t take the dignity away from our police. We have incredible people. They\\u2019ve been protecting us for a long time. I mean, we are here, and I feel very safe being in this room. These are great people. We can\\u2019t take their dignity away. We have to let them be able to do what they do better than anybody else. So I think we have to look at it that way. We have to be very, very careful. Police are so afraid today, that they do something slightly wrong, slightly wrong, and their pension\\u2019s gone, their job\\u2019s gone, who knows what happens? Their life is ruined, their wife or their husband will leave, the whole thing, it\\u2019s a very scary thing to do.\\nDonald Trump: (01:07:52)\\nAnd then you look at safety. I mean, you look at that horrible human being that shot these two police, [inaudible 01:07:59] right next, just a disgusting and then ran off. You look at that. This is a very tough job and it\\u2019s a very unsafe job. It\\u2019s a very dangerous job. We have to give them back their dignity and we have to give them back respect. These are great people, for the most part. There\\u2019s always going to be a bad apple in your business, in my business, no matter what. I mean, there\\u2019s going to be bad apples so we have to weed out the bad apples, but we have to give the police back that strength that they had a short while ago and that they have in Republican cities, frankly, and states. But you take a look, this is a Democrat problem.\\nDonald Trump: (01:08:39)\\nGeorge, I know you\\u2019re a Democrat, but this is largely a Democrat problem. If you just take a look at the list, every Democrat city, almost, not all, but a lot of them certainly in the top 25, even if you go to the top 50, almost every city is run by the Democrats. People don\\u2019t respect our police and they have to respect them-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09:02)\\nMr.President, you promised four years ago-\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:02)\\nRespect our police.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09:02)\\nMr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:02)\\nAnd they have to respect them.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09:02)\\nYou promised four years ago at the Republican Convention, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to restore law and order in this country-\\u201d\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:08)\\nAnd I have, except in Democrat-run cities. Look, we have laws. We have to go by the laws. We can\\u2019t move in the National Guard. I can call insurrection, but there\\u2019s no reason to ever do that. Even in a Portland case. We can\\u2019t call in the National Guard unless we\\u2019re requested by a governor. If a governor or a mayor is a Democrat, like in Portland, we call them constantly. I just spoke to the governor yesterday, because we\\u2019re giving them relief from the fires. We\\u2019re giving them an emergency declaration. I said, \\u201cGovernor, let us go in and we\\u2019ll clean up Portland so fast. In a half an hour, it\\u2019ll be all right.\\u201d And she\\u2019s just torn by it. I don\\u2019t understand the thinking, but they are torn by it. I have a lot of respect for the governor, frankly, and what happened in Minneapolis was pretty amazing.\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:56)\\nUnfortunately, it just went on for a week or a week and a half before he allowed us to bring in the National Guard. When we brought in the National Guard, everything stopped, the crime was gone, meaning the whole thing. But by that time, a big portion of the city was burned down. We\\u2019re talking about Minneapolis. In Seattle, we let them know we\\u2019re coming in. They took over a big chunk of the city, 20% of the city. We said, \\u201cWe\\u2019re coming in.\\u201d As soon as we said that the police department went in and these other people were exhausted, but had we not said we\\u2019re going in, we were ready to go in, we were going in the following morning, wherever you have a Democrat city, not in all cases, but if you look at the really troubled cities in our country, they\\u2019re Democrat-run and that\\u2019s Biden.\\nDonald Trump: (01:10:43)\\nThey\\u2019re weak, they\\u2019re ineffective.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:10:45)\\nMr. President, you\\u2019re president for those cities right now.\\nDonald Trump: (01:10:47)\\nI\\u2019m president, but I can only do what I\\u2019m allowed to do. George. I don\\u2019t need insurrection. I don\\u2019t need an insurrection act to take care of 250 anarchists. We can do that very easily with the National Guard. We proved that in Minneapolis. They came in after the city was burning. And the thing I don\\u2019t really get is that the news media is saying, \\u201cNo, these are peaceful. These are peaceful.\\u201d And right over the reporter, it was a CNN reporter, right over his shoulder, and you saw that, right over his shoulder, the city is burning. It looked like it was Berlin during the war. It was the craziest thing I\\u2019ve ever seen, and he\\u2019s trying to say, I don\\u2019t know why the news media tries to make so light of it. These are not protests. These are far greater than protests.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:11:32)\\nGot to take another quick break.\\nCommercial: (01:11:38)\\nNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. 2020, The President and The People will return after this.\\nCommercial: (01:16:32)\\nFrom the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:16:37)\\nWelcome back to our Town meeting with President Trump. We\\u2019re taking questions. Pennsylvania voters have not made up their minds this election. Next one comes from Flor Cruceta. She\\u2019s from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She has not voted before because she just became a citizen.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:50)\\nOh, very good.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:16:52)\\nThank you so much. Hi, Mr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:54)\\nThank you.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:16:55)\\nMr. George. Hi everyone. My name is Flor Cruceta. Sorry if I can\\u2019t hold my tears. [crosstalk 01:17:02] I came in 2006 with my mom from Dominican Republic. Sorry.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:20)\\nThat\\u2019s all right. And just take your time. That\\u2019s fine. George has plenty of time. I hope, right?\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:17:25)\\nAbsolutely.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:25)\\nThank you. Did you say your mom got COVID?\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:17:27)\\nWe come from Dominican Republic in 2006 to live our American dream. But she forget how to take care of herself, and she died last month. Sorry.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:49)\\nTerrible. And that\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s okay.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:17:56)\\nShe have breast cancer, but it made metastasized on her brain, bone, and lungs. And she passed on the 19. One of her biggest dream was to become a citizen to vote and she did. She did it 10 days before she died and I did it too. She pushed me so hard to do it and I did it this past 28. I\\u2019m here because of her. She was supposed to be here and ask you and thank you for the [inaudible 01:18:29] you take during this epidemic. You made people closer. We lost our job but we learn how to love our family. So I\\u2019m saying that from her.\\nDonald Trump: (01:18:41)\\nVery nice.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:18:46)\\nHere\\u2019s a question for you both because she write this question. What will you do for our immigration system? What would you change to make more people like me and like her to become citizen and vote?\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:02)\\nSo, we are doing something with immigration that I think is going to be very strong because we want people to come into our country, people like you and like your mother, and that just shows how vicious the COVID is, especially when you have another problem, you have a heart problem or another type of a problem. And it\\u2019s a very sad story, but we want people to come into our country. We want them to come in, a lot of people, but we want them to come in through a legal system, through a system that they love our country, they work to come into our country, a merit system, and we\\u2019re working on something very hard right now and in a very short time, we\\u2019re going to be announcing it. And I think it\\u2019s going to have quite an impact. I think it\\u2019s going to be something that actually will be popular for all.\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:48)\\nI mean, as far as your situation with your mother, that is just devastating. Because I can imagine how you feel and sounds like a great woman, and I\\u2019ll tell you, I\\u2019m pretty good with people. She gave us a great daughter, a great child. What she\\u2019s done with you, the way you are, the love that you have for your mother, I can see that. It\\u2019s hard, and so many people, and they die alone. They die alone because this is such a vicious thing. You can\\u2019t go there and hold their hand. You can\\u2019t give them a kiss goodnight. It\\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing. And hopefully the vaccines are going to be very soon. Hopefully. Did you have COVID? You didn\\u2019t have it, right?\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:20:26)\\nNo.\\nDonald Trump: (01:20:26)\\nYou didn\\u2019t have it, mother. We\\u2019ll have it taken care of. It\\u2019s going to get taken care of. The vaccines are going to make a big difference. What has made a big difference is Remdesevir. We have many things now and things are going to be announced soon, which frankly, if you take a look at some of the things we\\u2019re doing in terms of the word wouldn\\u2019t be cure, but the word would be therapeutically or therapeutics, we have some incredible things which is so important. And I view that actually in a certain way is more important than the vaccine where you can go into a hospital and get your mother and give her a transfusion or a shot and they can get better, get better much faster. So we have some of those things and they\\u2019ve been very, very successful, but we have others coming out and in order to get them, we had to get the FDA to approve these products, these very sophisticated medicines, I guess you could call them medicine, but we had to get them approved very quickly and they did it.\\nDonald Trump: (01:21:25)\\nDr. Hahn, the head of the FDA, Alex Azar, they\\u2019ve really done a fantastic job. I believe George that none of this would have happened in another administration. And I think you know that. The FDA is approving things at a level that they\\u2019ve never done and at speed with which they\\u2019ve never acted before.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:21:44)\\nBig question is, is it being done safely? We\\u2019ve got to take a another break. We\\u2019re going to be right back [crosstalk 01:21:47].\\nCommercial: (01:21:52)\\nThe right of citizens of the United States who are 18 years of age or older to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of age.\\nCommercial: (01:22:06)\\nThis special edition of 2020 will return in a moment. The President and The People, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:27:12)\\nWelcome back to our town meeting. We have time for one final question that comes from Ashley West of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.\\nAshley West: (01:27:17)\\nHi Mr. Trump.\\nDonald Trump: (01:27:19)\\nHi Ashley.\\nAshley West: (01:27:21)\\nSorry. My question is, what has been the most difficult part of your presidency and what have you learned from it?\\nDonald Trump: (01:27:29)\\nSo I think without question, I would say, because things were going so well, I think I\\u2019d have to say the whole COVID, the China virus as I call it because it comes from China so I think it\\u2019s a much more accurate term. But it\\u2019s been very difficult, it\\u2019s been so sad. As an example, talking to you about your mother, it\\u2019s just such a sad situation. Yeah, we\\u2019re getting there, we will get there, we\\u2019re going to, it\\u2019s going to happen, but it\\u2019s been very difficult, nobody\\u2019s seen anything like this probably since 1970 [inaudible 01:28:03].\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:28:04)\\nWhat did you learn from it?\\nDonald Trump: (01:28:07)\\nI learned that life is very fragile. I knew people that were powerful people, strong people, good people, and they got knocked out by this and died. Six people. It was five until about two weeks ago, now it\\u2019s six. But I\\u2019ve learned that life is very fragile because these were strong people and all of a sudden they were dead, they were gone, and it wasn\\u2019t their fault. It was the fault of a country that could have stopped it. And I made a great trade deal with China,\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:28:39)\\nAny of it was your fault?\\nDonald Trump: (01:28:41)\\nI feel so differently about that deal now. It\\u2019s a great deal. It was good for the farmers, good for the manufacturers, but I don\\u2019t view it the same way. It was good for us, but I don\\u2019t view it the same way because of the horror of this disease that really could have been stopped at the border.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:28:57)\\nCould you have done more to stop it?\\nDonald Trump: (01:28:59)\\nI don\\u2019t think so. I think what I did by closing up the country, I think I saved two, maybe two and a half, maybe more than that lives. I really don\\u2019t think so. I think we did a very good job. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s been recognized. We\\u2019ve made a lot of governors feel good. We\\u2019ve made some, reputationally. We\\u2019ve enhanced their reputation. They didn\\u2019t have anything, we got them the supplies, we got them the ventilators. We\\u2019ve made a lot of people look good that shouldn\\u2019t look good to be honest with you.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:29:26)\\nWe\\u2019re out of time, Mr. President. Thank you for your time.\\nDonald Trump: (01:29:28)\\nThank you very much.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:29:29)\\nThanks to all the questions here and thanks to all of you at home for watching.

A fruit’s a fruit, right?It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen  has just testified to the United States Congress  that global warming trends are caused by human activity, and will pose an increasing threat  to humanity in the future.Well, well.  That’s unusually prescient for a human.Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It’s sleek, flattering and modest—  just like the traditional dress.Commercials. Could anything be more insufferable?It’s 1997, and the United States Senate  has called a hearing about global warming. Some expert witnesses point out that  past periods in Earth’s history were warmer than the 20th century. Because such variations existed long before humans, the witnesses claim the current warming trend is also the result of natural variation.Ah, there is something more insufferable than a commercial. Luckily for the humans,  there’s one more expert witness.What are you looking at?  We’re all dressed. At least we are by the logic  you just used. It’s as if you were to say  apples and oranges are both fruits, therefore they taste the same. Or that underwear, wedding dresses,  and suits are all clothes, therefore, they’re all equally appropriate attire for a Senate hearing.The European wars of the 19th century  and World War I were all wars, right?So World War I couldn’t be any more devastating than those other wars, could it?Let’s say two people have a fever. They must have the same disease  that’s causing that fever, right?Of course not.  One fever could be caused by chicken pox, the other by influenza,  or any number of other infections. Like your claim about rising global temperatures, these claims make a false analogy. You're assuming that because two phenomena share a characteristic, in this case warming,  they are analogous in other ways, like the cause of that warming.But there’s no evidence  that that’s the case. Yes, there have been other warm periods  in Earth’s history— no one’s disputing that the climate  fluctuates. But let's take a closer look at some of those older examples of global warming, shall we?The Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse, 92 million years ago, was so warm,  forests covered Antarctica. Volcanic activity was likely responsible for boosting atmospheric carbon dioxide and creating a greenhouse effect.The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,  55 million years ago, was so warm, crocodiles swam the waters of the Arctic Circle. This warming may have been caused by the drying of inland seas and release of methane,  a potent greenhouse gas, from ocean sediments,Even among these other warm periods, you’re making a false analogy. Yes, they had natural causes. But each had a different cause, and involved a different amount  and duration of warming. They’re as dissimilar as they are similar. Taking them together,  all we can reasonably conclude is that the Earth’s climate  seems to change in response to conditions on the planet.Today, human activity is a dominant force shaping conditions on your planet, so the possibility that it’s driving global warming can’t be dismissed out of hand. I’ll grant that the more complicated  something is, the easier it is to make a mistaken analogy. That’s especially true because there are many different types of false analogy: that similar symptoms must share a cause, that similar actions must lead to similar consequences, and countless others. Most false analogies you’ll come  across are far less obvious than those comparing apples to oranges,  and climate is notoriously complex. It requires careful, rigorous study and evidence collection— and making a false analogy like this only impedes that process.It’s 2013, and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found,  aggregating decades of research, that there is more than a 95% chance  the global warming trend since the mid-20th century  has been driven by human activity, namely the burning of fossil fuels.You’re both pets, and he likes living in water, so you should, too.\"\"\"\n",
